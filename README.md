To run the program:
1. Open the index.html

To view the detailed date, maximum, and minimum temperature (the tooltip):
1. Hover on the chart (and not on the color legend)

To view the points at a specified time interval:
1. Hover on the color legend

Notes:
* The web's zoom setting have to be at 100% so that the mouse hover feature can be run correctly as the program does not support the resizing feature
* The color in the chart represents the month of the data
* The tooltip box's size is set to a fixed number, not based on the content
* The temperature in the tooltip is rounded to the first decimal digit
* The time interval on the color legend is set to 30 days (also valid on the boundary, where the highlight bar is always shown fully to show that the interval shown is still at 30 days)
* The points not included in the time interval can also be seen during the color legend mouse hover. However, its opacity is extremely low compared to the points included in the time interval

* The marginal distribution on the top is for the minimum temperature, while the marginal distribution on the right is for the maximum temperature
* The color of the marginal distribution during the hover on the color legend represents the color of the month at the beginning of the time interval
